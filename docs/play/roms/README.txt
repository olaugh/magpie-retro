ROM FILES PLACEHOLDER
=====================

Place your Shadow Scrabble ROM binaries in this directory with the following names:

  shadow-nwl.bin  -  Shadow NWL (North American dictionary)
  shadow-csw.bin  -  Shadow CSW (International dictionary)

The emulator expects these exact filenames. The files should be raw Genesis/Mega Drive
ROM binaries (typically .bin or .md format, but rename to .bin).

Note: ROM files are not included in version control due to size and licensing.
